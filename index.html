      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Alina Hernandez (she/her/hers) is the Principal Consultant for the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus and President of the LGBTQ Capitol Association. Her work has advanced numerous policies related to equality and civil rights, including AB 2969, which officially made June the month of Pride in California. The law resulted in the Pride flag flying over the Capitol for the first time in state history. Alina also played a key role in crafting ACR 269, which requested the California lawmakers to use only gender-neutral pronouns when drafting new laws. Before venturing into public policy, Alina worked for the state’s Employment Development Department as a computer hardware and software technician. She was born on an Air Force base in Germany and grew up in the greater Sacramento area. She later studied at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising and graduated from City College of San Francisco’s Emergency Medical Technician program. Alina now lives in East Sacramento with her partner and their dog, Lemon.</p>
